# CurseApp

> Angular 5 app served through Angular CLI, styled using Sass using Bootstrap framework and ngx-bootstrap; graphs rendered through ngx-charts

## Objectives 
 
Build a Web Page: Use the mock, assets, and data provided build a simple static application form that includes a graph displaying the applicants (graph_array_data.txt) youtube stats. Use the mock as an outline, but feel free to make changes to sizes, margins, and color as you see fit.
* [x] Compile CSS: **[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)**
* [x] Use your preferred Javascript framework: **[Angular](https://angular.io/)**
* [x] Use your preferred solution for rendering the graph (free or commercial): **[ngx-charts](https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-charts)**
* [x] Consider responsive design on implementation: **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** and **[ngx-bootstrap](https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap)**
